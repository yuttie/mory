# mory Documentation

Welcome to mory documentation!

**mory is designed to be a part of your memory.**

With mory, you can capture notes, manage your calendar, and track tasks‚Äîfreeing your mind to focus on what matters. Think of it as: **my memory = me + mory**.

## What is mory?

mory is a personal note-taking application that combines the power of Markdown with Git-based storage. It's designed as a **personal tool for private use only**, intentionally built without multi-user support or collaboration features to keep things simple and your data under your control.

### Core Features

- **üìù Rich Note Taking** - Write and organize your thoughts in Markdown with live preview
- **üìÖ Calendar Integration** - Manage events and schedule directly within your notes
- **‚úÖ Task Management** - Track todos and projects with built-in task management
- **üìÅ File Management** - Organize and access all your files in one place
- **üîç Powerful Search** - Find any note, task, or file quickly
- **üé® Customizable** - Choose your preferred editor theme, syntax highlighting, and styling

### Design Principles

The core design principle is simple: your content should always be accessible and editable locally, without relying on a web app. To achieve this, mory is built on two key ideas:

- **Git-powered storage** ‚Äî all data is versioned and managed through a Git repository instead of a traditional database
- **Markdown-native format** ‚Äî everything is stored as plain Markdown files, ensuring your data stays portable, human-readable, and future-proof

### Key Benefits

- **Always accessible** - Your data is stored locally as plain text files
- **Version controlled** - Every change is tracked through Git
- **Future-proof** - Markdown files will always be readable
- **Portable** - Export and migrate your data easily
- **Private** - No cloud dependencies, your data stays with you
